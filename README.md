# Speech-Auto-Timer
(In progress)
League of Legends Speech recognition script to keep tracks of objective timers

Use microphone to say when summonner spell got used. Script then makes it easy to paste it into the chat with when the summonner spell will be back up.

Keypresses:
- Home: 3 seconds to record timer (role (top,jungle,middle,botton,middle) + summonner spell + minutes and seconds it was used) ie:  top flash 2020 (twenty twenty, two zero two zero, 2 thousand 20)
- Enter: Types in all current timers that are still active  (in progress)

Todo: 
- Automatically remove timers that finishes
- Find methodology to keep track of teleport(based on timer different cooldowns)
- Improve speech recognition
