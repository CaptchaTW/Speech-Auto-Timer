# Speech-Auto-Timer
(In progress but somewhat usable)
League of Legends Speech recognition script to keep tracks of objective timers

Track summoner spells cooldowns in chat with voice.

Keypresses:
- Home: 3 seconds to record timer (role (top,jungle,middle,botton,middle) + summonner spell + minutes and seconds it was used) 
ie:  top flash 2020 (twenty twenty, two zero two zero, 2 thousand 20)
- Insert: Types in all current timers that are still active  (in progress)

Todo: 
- <s>Automatically remove timers that finishes</s>
- Find methodology to keep track of teleport(based on LVL, not the same system as other summonners)
- Improve speech recognition
- Lock keys until finish recording
